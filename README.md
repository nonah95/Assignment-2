#Part 1: Visualizing the data 

visualize a wine quality dataset using a scatter plot to show the relationship between two variables, "Alcohol" and "Malic Acid," and their association with wine quality. 

- **Figure Setup**: `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))` specifies the plot size.
- **Scatter Plot**: `plt.scatter(...)` plots "Alcohol" on the x-axis and "Malic Acid" on the y-axis, with colors representing wine quality.
- **Title and Labels**: `plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel` set the title and axis labels.
- **Color Bar**: `plt.colorbar(...)` adds a color bar to indicate the quality scale.
- **Display Plot**: `plt.show()` renders the plot.
